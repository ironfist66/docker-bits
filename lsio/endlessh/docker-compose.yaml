# [Endlessh](https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh) is an SSH tarpit that very
# slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner. It keeps SSH clients locked up for
# hours or even days at a time. The purpose is to put your real SSH server on
# another port and then let the script kiddies get stuck in this tarpit instead
# of bothering a real server.

      # The length of each line is randomized. This controls the maximum length of each line. Shorter lines may keep clients on for longer if they give up after a certain number of bytes.

      # By default, the app logs to container log. If this is set to `true`, the log will be output to file under `/config/logs/endlessh` (`/config` needs to be mapped).

      # By default, the app binds to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Set it to `4` or `6` to bind to IPv4 only or IPv6 only, respectively. Leave blank to bind to both.
