# [Endlessh](https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh) is an SSH tarpit that very
# slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner. It keeps SSH clients locked up for
# hours or even days at a time. The purpose is to put your real SSH server on
# another port and then let the script kiddies get stuck in this tarpit instead
# of bothering a real server.
